Subject: [PATCH 0/4] stm32: add stm32f7 family support

This patchset:
	- adds support for stm32f7 family.
	- adds support for stm32f746 disco board.
	- moves base addresses & clock config from stm32 gpio
	  driver to soc area to be usable by stm32f7.

Vikas Manocha (4):
  gpio: stm32_gpio: move clock config from driver to board
  gpio: stm32_gpio: move base addresses to the soc file
  stm32x7: add support for stm32x7 serial driver
  stm32: add support for stm32f7 & stm32f746 discovery board
