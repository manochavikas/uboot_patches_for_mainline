Subject: [PATCH v3 00/10] stm32f7: add clock and pin control drivers

This patchset:
	- adds support for stm32f7 clock driver.
	- adds support for stm32f7 pin control driver.
	- adds device tree nodes for stm32f7 serial & clock.
	- adds stm32f7 pin control device tree sub nodes :
	  	- serial usart1
		- ethernet
		- qspi flash

Changed in v3:
- remove get length of pin control sub node as not required in case of
  fdtdec_get_int_array_count

Changed in v2:
- added removed blank lines in code.
- removed not used functions.
- changed fixed length array read from device node to relaxed length read.
