Subject: [PATCH 00/18] stm32f7: add sdram & gpio drivers

This patchset :
	- adds stm32 sdram driver based on DM
	- adds stm32 gpio driver based on DM
	- uses clock & pin control drivers to replace board specific
	  configurations from code
	- corrects sdram parameters as per correct sdram part
	- adds support for stm32f769 board

Vikas Manocha (18):
  stm32f7: use clock driver to enable qspi controller clock
  stm32f7: sdram: move sdram driver code to ram drivers area
  stm32f7: dm: add driver model support for sdram
  ARM: DT: stm32f7: add sdram pin contol node
  stm32f7: use driver model for sdram initialization
  stm32f7: use clock driver to enable sdram controller clock
  stm32f7: sdram: use sdram device tree node to configure sdram
    controller
  dm: gpio: Add driver for stm32f7 gpio controller
  ARM: DT: stm32f7: add gpio device tree nodes
  stm32f7: use stm32f7 gpio driver supporting driver model
  stm32f746: to switch on user LED1 & read user button
  stm32f7: stm32f746-disco: read memory info from device tree
  stm32f7: enable board info read from device tree
  stm32f7: sdram: correct sdram configuration as per micron sdram
  stm32f7: increase the max no of pin configuration to 70
  stm32f7: move board specific pin muxing to dts
  stm32f7: add support for stm32f769 disco board
  stm32f7: remove not needed configuration from board config
