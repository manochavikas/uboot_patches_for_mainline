Subject: [PATCH v4 00/18] stm32f7: add sdram & gpio drivers

This patchset :
	- adds stm32 sdram driver based on DM
	- adds stm32 gpio driver based on DM
	- uses clock & pin control drivers to replace board specific
	  configurations from code
	- corrects sdram parameters as per correct sdram part
	- adds support for stm32f769 board

Changed in v4:
- rebased to master.

Changed in v3:
- made stm32_gpio_config() static.
- moved common.h inclusion before clk.h

Changed in v2:
- included files in correct order.
- moved the pinctrl specific routine from gpio driver to pinctrl
- used dev_get_addr() instead of fdtdec_get_addr_size_auto_parent() in
  gpio driver.
- pointed gpio name to bank name in device tree blob rather than copy.
